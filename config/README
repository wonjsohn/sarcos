In order to use the imake and make functions of this directory, the 
following unix commands have to be issued:

alias imake  'imake -I$LAB_ROOT/config -TLAB_Imake.tmpl -D$MACHTYPE'

We assume that the "make" command is GNU make.
We assume that "imake" is installed, usually as part of X11
We assume that you use a tcsh (otherwise some environment variables will be missing).
We assume that $LAB_ROOT points to directory where the "config/" directory
is installed.

If you copy this imake facility and use different path names than given
here, you might want to change the LAB.cf file. It specifies the default
paths to some directories where to install files, like libraries, header
files, and binary files. Changing these variable should be straight
forward and self-explanatory.

Note that Imakefiles use a variety of special variable. Some of them
are shown below, but this list is not complete. To find out which
other variable are used for which Imake rules, check the LAB_Imake.rules
and LAB_Imake.tmpl files. This gives you a hint to what is going on.

You will also find in config/ some shell scripts to setup your unix
environment.

/*****************************************************************************
 Definition of variables:

 SOURCES  : All source files which are used in this Imakefile. Imake
            will automatically generate dependencies to keep these
            source files up-to-date with repect to included header files.

 HEADERS  : All header to be kept up to data
 OBJECTS  : All object files to be used in certain rules. See LAB_Imake.rules
 SRCDIR   : Directory where source files come from (global variable)
 LIBDIR   : Where to install a lib
 HEADERDIR: Where to install header files
 BINDIR   : Where to install executables
 INCLUDES : All include directories
